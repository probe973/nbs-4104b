## Questions

### Question 1

A small company of 20 people runs a weekly raffle where there are always 2 prizes.  Each employee gets 1 raffle entry for every year they have worked there, so during your first year you don't have a ticket in the draw.  Before the draw today the combined total years people have worked there is 80 years.

A ticket is drawn, the winner picks their prize, the winning ticket is returned to the draw and a second winner is drawn.

**Note that** parts a to c are all related to calculating a probability for an individual employee.


**Part a**

In a weekly draw, what is the probability that **you** will win the first prize if **you are** (**Give answers as decimals between 0 and 1**, and if required, give answers to 3 decimal places):

**Part b**

A particular employee has been working there for 8 years.  What is the probability that in a weekly draw that: (**Give answers as decimals between 0 and 1**, and if required, give answers to 3 decimal places)

    solution_text="$P(\text{1st and 2nd prize})=P(\text{1st prize}) \times P(\text{2nd prize given 1st prize})=\frac{1}{10} \times \frac{1}{10}=\frac{1}{100}=0.01$"
%}

**Part c**

The company decides to change the nature of the draw, and the first prize winning ticket is no longer returned to the draw.  Work out the probability, for the individuals given, of winning. (**Give answers as decimals between 0 and 1**, and if required, give answers to 3 decimal places)

### Question 3

At the bar of the company ‘The Pecs Bar & Gym’, customers can pay for items via different means.  30% of customers now use NFC on their smartphone to pay at the bar.  The company also has an app that gives news, information and offers to customers, 70% of customers have installed this app.  20% of customers use their smartphones to pay and have the company app.

## Independent Events

If there are two events $A$ and $B$ and we find that $P(A \text{ given } B) = P(A)$, then the event B occurring did not effect the probability of A.  In this case we say that events $A$ and $B$ are **independent events**.

A company records and finds that 82% of its members make use of the car park when they visit.  Of these 82%, 23% regularly use the café for refreshments during the visit.  For those who do not use the car park 64% obtain refreshments.
