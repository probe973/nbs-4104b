# Two-way (Contingency) Frequency Tables

<div class="instructions" markdown="1">

A two-way frequency table (or contingency table) shows data for two categorical variables, using rows for one variable and columns for the other, showing the frequency of observations in each combination.

For example, let's say you look at a company that offers working from home and working from the office.  On a particular day you record how many people work from home and how many work from the office and within these categories you record whether they had a lunch made at their own home.

| Place of work/Homemade Lunch | Homemade lunch | Lunch from external source | TOTAL |
|:----|:----|:----|:----|
| Work from home | 24 | 6 | 30 |
| Work from office | 12 | 28 | 40 |
| TOTAL | 36 | 34 | 70 |

This shows you information such as:
* There were 70 people working that day
* 30 people worked from home
* Of the 30 people working from home, 6 had an external sourced lunch
* and so on

From the frequencies we can work out probabilities.
