# Probability Formula

<div class="instructions" markdown="1">

### $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$

In everyday use language, the $\cup$ symbol can be considered as the word **or** and the $\cap$ symbol can be considered as the word **and**.  So the formula above says, for events A and B:

$$P(A \text{ OR } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \text{ AND } B)$$

So for example, if we know the probability that an event called *A* occurs with probability 0.7, the probability of an event called *B* occurs with probability 0.6, and the probability that they both occur is 0.4, then:

$$P(A \text{ OR } B) = 0.7 + 0.6 - 0.4 = 0.9$$

The probability that A or B occur is 0.9.

**Example**

For a particular group, it is known that the probability that they own a cat is 0.45, the probability that they own a dog is 0.3, and the probability that they own a cat or a dog is 0.63.  What is the probability that a randomly selected person owns a cat and a dog.

Let $C = \text{owns a cat}$ 

Let $D = \text{owns a dog}$

We have: $P(C) = 0.45$, $P(D) = 0.3$, $P(C \text{ OR } D) = 0.63$ and:

$P(C \text{ OR } D) = P(C) + P(D) - P(C \text{ AND } D) \implies 0.63 = 0.4 + 0.3 - P(C \text{ AND } D) \implies P(C \text{ AND } D) = 0.07$

### $P(\bar{A})=1-P(A)$

This formula says: $P(A \text{ not occurring}) = 1 - P(A \text{ occurring})$

Note that this can be re-arranged to read $P(A) = 1 - P(\bar{A})$
