# Single Event Probability

<div class="instructions" markdown="1">

### Calculating the probability of an event

To calculate the probability that an event will happen you need to use:

$$P(\text{Event}) = \frac{\text{number of ways event can happen}}{\text{total number of possible outcomes}}$$

You will see the solution written as either a fraction, a decimal, or a percentage.

**Example**

A bag contains 20 counters, 3 are coloured red, 12 are coloured blue, and the rest are coloured green.

* What is the probability of drawing a **red** counter?

There are 3 red counters out of a possible 20 counters.  Therefore the probability is:

$$P(\text{red}) = \frac{3}{20} \text{ or } = 0.15 = 15 \% $$

* What is the probability of not drawing a **blue** counter?

There 12 blue counters, so 8 are not blue.

$$P(\text{not blue}) = \frac{8}{20} =\frac{2}{5} \text{ or } = 0.4 = 40 \% $$

### Calculating expected number of outcomes

Given a constant probability of an evenet occurring, you can calculate how many *successful* outcomes you would expect if repeated a set number of times:

$$\text{Expected number of outcomes} = P(\text{outcome}) \times \text{number of repeats}$$

**Example**

A spinner lands on green with a probability of $\frac{2}{5}$.  If the spinner is spun 20 times, how many times would you expect it to land on green?

$$\text{Expected number of greens} = \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8$$
