### Part 1: Converting Fractions to Percentages

A fraction represents a division. To convert any fraction to a percentage:

1.  **Divide** the numerator by the denominator.
2.  **Multiply** the result by 100.

**Example:** Convert $\frac{3}{8}$ to a percentage.
*   Calculation: $3 \div 8 \times 100 = 37.5$
*   Answer: $37.5$ (representing 37.5%)

### Part 2: Finding a Percentage of an Amount

To calculate a percentage of an amount, convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply.

**The Method:**
1.  **Decimal:** Divide the percentage by 100.
2.  **Multiply:** $\text{Decimal} \times \text{Amount}$.

**Example:** Find 24% of 500.
*   Decimal: $24 \div 100 = 0.24$
*   Calculation: $0.24 \times 500 = 120$

### Part 3: Calculating Percentage Change

This method calculates the percentage increase or decrease between two values.

**The Method:**
1.  **Difference:** Subtract the two numbers.
2.  **Divide:** $\text{Difference} \div \text{Original Number}$.
3.  **Percentage:** Multiply by 100.

**Example:** A price rises from 50 to 65.
*   Difference: $15$.
*   Calculation: $15 \div 50 \times 100 = 30$. (Answer is 30%)

### Part 4: Percentage Multipliers (Increase and Decrease)

We can increase or decrease an amount in one step by finding the **Total Percentage**.

**For an Increase:**
*   Add the percentage to 100%. Convert this to a decimal.
*   *Example (Increase by 20%):* Total is $120\%$. As a decimal, this is **1.20**.

**For a Decrease:**
*   Subtract the percentage from 100%. Convert this to a decimal.
*   *Example (Decrease by 20%):* Total is $80\%$. As a decimal, this is **0.80**.

**Calculation:** $\text{Original Amount} \times \text{Multiplier}$.

### Part 5: Reverse Percentages

This method finds the **Original Value** when you know the final amount after a percentage change.

**The Method:**
1.  Find the multiplier just like in Part 4.
2.  **Divide** the final amount by this multiplier.

**Equation:** $\text{Final Amount} \div \text{Multiplier} = \text{Original Amount}$
