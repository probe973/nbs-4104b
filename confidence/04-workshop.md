# Confidence Intervals

<div class="explanation" markdown="1">
    
## Known Population Variance

A confidence interval for the population mean when the population variance, $\sigma^2$, is known can be calculated using the sample mean ($\bar{x}$), known population standard deviation ($\sigma$), sample size ($n$), and a $z$-value corresponding to the desired confidence level. The formula is: 

$$\bar{x} \pm z \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$

| Confidence Interval | 90% | 95% | 99% |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| z | 1.645 | 1.96 | 2.576 |

### Questions

A company has a hot drinks machine in the staff room.  The machine produces hot drinks whose volume is known to be normally distributed.  The manufacturer has found that the mean volume is 300 ml with a standard deviation of 5 ml.

Those working for the company are concerned that the machine has started to give the wrong volume.  A sample of 20 drinks is taken and a sample mean of 298 ml is found.

$$\text{SEM} = \frac{\text{Standard Deviation}}{\sqrt{\text{Sample size}}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} $$

## Unknown Population Variance

To calculate a confidence interval for the mean when the population variance is unknown, you use the t-distribution and the sample standard deviation, $s$, as an estimate for the population standard deviation. The formula is:

$$\bar{x} \pm t \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$

The t-score is determined by the desired confidence level and the degrees of freedom (df).

### Questions

A call centre claims that patients wait on hold for an average of 40 seconds.  A random sample of 8 callers gave the following hold times (in seconds).

$$x \text{: } 45, 39, 42, 48, 38, 40, 41, 51$$

$$\sum x = 344 \text{, } \sum(x-\bar{x})^2=148 \text{, } s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum(x-\bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$$

{% capture ci_solution_cip6 %}
$\bar{x}=\frac{344}{8}=43$

$s=\sqrt{\frac{148}{8-1}}=4.60$

$\text{SEM}=\frac{4.60}{\sqrt{8}}=1.63$

$df=7$

$t_{7,95}=2.365$

$43 \pm 2.365 \times 1.63
= 43 \pm 3.85
= (39.15,\;46.85)$
