# Calculating a confidence interval for the mean, with an uknown population standard deviation

If you do not have the population standard deviation when calculating a confidence interval for the mean, you can make use of the standard deviation of the sample.  When doing this you will need to make use of the **t-distribution**, rather than the normal distribution.

$$ \bar{x} \pm t_\text{critical} \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$

Where $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean, $s$ is the sample standard deviation, $n$ is the sample size, and $t_\text{critical}$ is based on the level of confidence and the **degrees of freedom (df)**.

The **df** here is given by: $\text{df} = n-1$

## Calculating the confidence interval

You can use the following calculator or tables of critical t-values.

<div class="gigacalculator" data-tool="/calculators/critical-value-calculator.php" data-width="450">
  <div class="gigacalctitle">Critical Value Calculator</div>
  <div class="gigacalcfooter">

So for a sample of size $n=16$, a sample mean $\bar{x}=50$ and sample standard deviation $s=10$ is calculated.

For a 95% confidence interval for the mean, using the calculator:

* Set it to **T-distributed**
* Set the **Type of test** to **One-tailed**
* Enter **0.025** as the **Significance leve** (this is half of 5%)
* Enter **15** as the **Degrees of Freedom**

You should find that $t_\text{critical}=2.131$.

You can also use the t-table <a href="/nbs-4104b/t-table/" target="_blank">here</a> to get a the critical t-value.  This can be used in confidence intervals and t-tests.

Therefore the 95% confidence interval is:

$$50 \pm 2.131 \times \frac{10}{\sqrt{16}} = 16 \pm 5.33$$

This can written as (44.67, 55.33)
