# Calculating a 95% confidence interval for the mean, with a known population standard deviation

The margin of error in a confidence interval is determined by the level of confidence, the sample size, and the standard deviation.  When the population standard deviation is known you can use the formula, for a 95% confidence interval:

$$\bar{x} \pm 1.96 \times \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} $$

Where $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean, $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation, $n$ is the sample size.

If the sample size is large, then this formula is a close approximation when using the sample standard deviation rather than the population.

## Other size confidence intervals

The $1.96$ part in the confidence interval for the mean of $\bar{x} \pm 1.96 \times \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} $ is linked to the 95%.

It can be derived from **normal tables** or by using the online calculator tool below.

To get this number for a **95%** interval:

* Choose **Z-distributed**
* If using **One-tailed** enter **0.025** into **Significance** or if using **Two-tailed** enter **0.05** into **Significance**
* Click **Calculate Critical Value**

You should see $1.96$ as the **Critical Z Value**.

For a **90% Confidence Interval**, we can use the calculator with the following **Z** settings:

* One-tailed - set significance to 0.05
* Two-tailed - set significance to 0.10

You should find that $1.645$ is the critical value.

So a 90% confidence interval for the mean can be calculated with, given population variance is known:

$$\bar{x} \pm 1.645 \times \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} $$
