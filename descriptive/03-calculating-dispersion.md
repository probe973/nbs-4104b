## Measures of Dispersion

As well as a central value, data can also be summarised by stating how spread out the values are.  These are **measures of dispersion**.

### Range
The **range** is the difference between the largest value and the smallest value, i.e. $ \text{largest} - \text{smallest} $.
The larger the range the more spread out the data is.

### Inter-quartile Range
The **inter-quartile range** is the difference between the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile.

The **percentiles** are points where that percentage of data are below this score.
So, the **25th percentile** is the point where 25% of data are below this value and 75% are avove this value.
The **75th percentile** is the point where 75% of data are below this value and 25% are above.

The **inter-quartile range** is the spread of the middle 50% of the data.

### Variance
The **variance** is a measure of dispersion which is a *mean of the squared distances from the mean*.  The larger the variance the more disperse the data are.

If you collect a sample of $n$ data points, with each value represented by $x_i$, and the mean of these data represented by $\bar{x}$, then the calculation needed for the **sample variance**, $s^2$ is:

$$s^2=\frac{\Sigma (x_i-\overline{x})^2}{n-1}$$

### Standard Deviation
The **variance** will have units that are the square of the original units.  So, if you are measuring an item in $m$ then the variance will be in $m^2$.  It is therefore common to use the **standard deviation** to represent spread.  The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.  So for the sample standard deviation, $s$:

$$s=\sqrt{\frac{\Sigma \left (x_{i} - \overline{x} \right )^2}{n-1}}$$

## Question

A customer, who visits the gym regularly, records on a sample of visits the number of kilometres they complete on the running machine.  The records are:

Distance, d (km): 12, 10, 14, 14, 11, 8, 15, 18, 15

Using $d_i$ to represent each data point and $\overline{d}$ to represent the mean calculated above:
